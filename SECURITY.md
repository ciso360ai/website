# Security Policy

We take the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [CISO360AI](https://github.com/ciso360ai).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability or issue in any CISO360AI-owned repository that meets our [definition of a security vulnerability](https://ciso360.ai/security-policy/), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Vulnerabilities or Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them by email to [security@ciso360.ai](mailto:security@ciso360.ai).

You should receive a response within 3 business days. If for some reason you do not, please follow up with a plain text intro email since email filters may have blocked your initial message.

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

We value the members of the independent security research community who find security vulnerabilities and work
with our team so that proper fixes can be issued to users. Our policy is to credit all researchers in the fix's release
notes. In order to receive credit, security researchers must follow responsible disclosure practices and the our policy for [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://ciso360.ai/security-policy/).

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Security Hall Of Fame

We would like to thank the following security researchers for having responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities to us!

If you wish to report a security vulnerability and get credit in our Security Hall of Fame please follow our [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://ciso360.ai/security-policy/).
